## Start
Hello, I'm Swarnil, a 27-year-old software engineer currently based in Bangalore. My journey began in the town of Mahroni, Uttar Pradesh, in July 1996. In pursuit of quality education, I spent my childhood in a boarding school, setting the stage for my academic path. The Kota chapter was quite the rollercoaster â€“ attempts to crack IIT/JEE might not have gone as planned, but fear not, I found my way to LNCT Bhopal, where I pursued Computer Science Engineering.

## Discovery Of My Passion For Youtube
Despite graduating without a job offer, In college, I stumbled upon my passion for YouTube. 'Imswarnil' became my creative outlet, a channel where each video not only shared tech insights but also reflected my love for creativity. This newfound passion added a positive twist to my journey.

## Job Seeker Me
the next chapter unfolded in Bangalore, I spent seven months navigating the challenges of job hunting, determined to land my first job. It was a journey filled with learning and resilience, and it all paid off when I finally got the job.

## My First Job, Stream and Salesforce
Started as a web developer in a startup, later at Accenture, my focus unexpectedly shifted to Salesforce. Assigned to the Salesforce stream, I blended technical skills with a creative touch, finding a unique way to make things beautiful within this new domain.

In this tech world, I discovered a newfound interest in UX design, combining my love for art and design. Life in Bangalore is an ongoing adventure, and through 'Imswarnil,' I document both my tech journey and personal experiences.
