best_comment: "The Editing Style was quite good. It was not a new way but I have never seen an Indian YouTuber doing it before. The background music was quite powerful and energetic. And when the video sync with the music, ahh! satisfaction! You really did a good job pointing some minute things like the toilet one. The video was overall good and the voiceover was quite relaxing. #FromBhu"
