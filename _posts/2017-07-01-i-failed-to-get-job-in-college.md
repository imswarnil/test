# The Descent into Uncertainty

I never thought my journey from LNCT Bhopal would lead to such a bleak outcome. As a Computer Science Engineering student, I had dreams as vast as the digital universe itself. Graduating filled with hopes, I set out to conquer the tech industry, armed with knowledge and enthusiasm.

## Struggling Against the Odds

- **Interviews**: Each rejection letter stung like a harsh critique of my abilities.
- **YouTube**: The subscribers trickled in like a slow internet connection, never reaching the numbers I dreamed of.
- **Returning Home**: The once-familiar streets now echoed with my uncertainty and self-doubt.

As I sit here, penning down my thoughts, I feel lost in this maze of expectations and failures. The road ahead seems shrouded in mist, with no guiding light to lead me. I never imagined I'd be at this crossroads, contemplating my future with a heavy heart.

What happens next, I cannot say. The uncertainty hangs over me like a storm cloud, ready to burst at any moment. Will I rise from this setback, stronger and wiser? Or will this be the end of my dreams, leaving me forever haunted by what could have been?

Only time will tell.
